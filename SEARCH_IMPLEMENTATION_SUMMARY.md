### State Management

**Search Store** (`src/stores/search.js`):
```javascript

- results: { users: [], organizations: [], events: [], total: number }
- suggestions: []
- loading: boolean
- currentTab: 'all' | 'users' | 'organizations' | 'events'

- advancedSearch(filters)
- fetchSuggestions(query)
- clearResults()
- clearSearch()
- setQuery(query)
- setTab(tab)
- nextPage()
- prevPage()
- goToPage(page)
```

### API Client

**Search API** (`src/api/search.js`):
- `searchAll(query)` - Unified search
- `searchUsers(query, page)` - User search with pagination
- `searchOrganizations(query, page)` - Organization search with pagination
- `searchEvents(query, page)` - Event search with pagination

  meta: { requiresAuth: true }
}
```

### Navigation Integration

## Language: English

All user-facing text is in English:

- Tab labels: "All", "Users", "Organizations", "Events"
- Loading message: "Searching..."
- Empty state: "No results found"
- Pagination: "Previous", "Next", "Page X / Y"
- No results: "Try searching with different keywords"

## Testing

### API Testing Results

**Test 1: Search for "am"**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/search?q=am"
```
Result: 1 user found

**Test 2: Search for "Netflix"**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/search?q=Netflix"
```
Result: 1 event found

**Test 3: Autocomplete for "am"**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/search/suggestions?q=am"
```
Result: 7 mixed results (4 users + 3 events)

### Frontend Testing

Development server running on: `http://localhost:5175`

**To test:**
1. Open browser at `http://localhost:5175`
2. Log in with your credentials
3. Use search bar in navigation
4. Type any search term (e.g., "am", "Netflix", email address)
5. Observe autocomplete suggestions
6. Press Enter or click to view full results
7. Switch between tabs
8. Test pagination if many results

## Dependencies

### Installed
- `@vueuse/core` - For debouncing and utility functions
- Installed via: `npm install @vueuse/core`
- Added 4 packages, 140 total packages audited

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Debouncing**: 300ms delay on input to reduce API calls
2. **Pagination**: 15 results per page (configurable)
3. **Suggestions Limit**: Max 5 results for autocomplete
4. **Lazy Loading**: Results loaded on demand per tab
5. **Efficient Queries**: LIKE searches with indexed fields

## Security

- All endpoints protected with `auth:sanctum` middleware
- Only authenticated users can search
- SQL injection prevention via Laravel's query builder
- XSS prevention via Vue.js automatic escaping

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Search result highlighting for matched terms
2. Recent searches history
3. Search filters in UI (date range, location, etc.)
4. Sorting options (relevance, date, name)
5. Full-text search with scoring
6. Elasticsearch integration for better performance
7. Search analytics and popular searches
8. Save search functionality
9. Advanced filters UI
10. Export search results
