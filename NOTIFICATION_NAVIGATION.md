## 🎯 Navigation Logic

### Switch Statement Implementation:
```javascript
switch (notificationType) {
  case 'application_status':
    // Go to event details
    router.push({ name: 'EventDetails', params: { id: eventId } })
    break

  case 'application_submitted':
    // Go to my applications
    router.push({ name: 'MyApplications' })
    break

  case 'new_application':
    // Go to event applications management
    router.push({ name: 'EventApplications', params: { id: eventId } })
    break

  case 'event_created':
  case 'event_updated':
  case 'event_reminder':
    // Go to event details
    router.push({ name: 'EventDetails', params: { id: eventId } })
    break

  case 'new_review':
    // Go to event details, reviews section
    router.push({ 
      name: 'EventDetails', 
      params: { id: eventId },
      hash: '#reviews'
    })
    break

  default:
    // Fallback logic
    if (eventId) {
      router.push({ name: 'EventDetails', params: { id: eventId } })
    } else if (userId) {
      router.push({ name: 'UserProfile', params: { id: userId } })
    }
}
```

Each notification contains:
```javascript
{
  id: 123,
  type: "database",
  data: {
